# Autonomous Vehicle & Robotics Simulation

This project simulates a simple autonomous robot navigating a 2D grid environment using the A* pathfinding algorithm. It demonstrates basic robotic movement, obstacle avoidance, and logging of actions to a separate output file.

## Features

- 2D grid environment with randomly generated obstacles
- A* pathfinding algorithm for efficient path planning
- Simulated robot movement along the computed path
- Logging of simulation steps to an output file (`simulation_output.log`)

## File Structure

Python source code :
autonomous-vehicle-robotics/ autonomous_vehicle_sim.py      # 

Output file with logs from a sample run:
simulation_output.log          # Output file with logs from a sample run 
## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- No external libraries required (uses only built-in modules)
